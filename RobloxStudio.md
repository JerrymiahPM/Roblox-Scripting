This is where you'll be working.  Let's focus on the explorer.

## Explorer

When scripting exploits, you'll mostly be using the workspace, players, and replicated storage/replicated first.  

- The workspace contains all of the objects displayed in the world.
- The players contain all the players in the game, scripts in the players, and the GUI.
- replicated storage/replicated first may contain scripts that run the game smoothly.

## Properties

Properties are everywhere.  You'll find properties in every object located in the explorer.  

## Conclusion

Now that you know more about the explorer, go back to the [Intro](Roblox-Scripting/Intro.md)
